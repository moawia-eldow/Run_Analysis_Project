### Study design:
===============

This tidy data was generated from the original dataset of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones [1]. The original dataset was collected 
from the experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

For each record in the data set, it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The original dataset was cleaned to prepare this tidy dataset using the following 5 steps: 

1- Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3- Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4- Labelling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5- Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The resulting tidy dataset is a dataset of average of mean and std measurements for each activity and each subject.
The tidy dataset contains 180 objects and 68 variables.
